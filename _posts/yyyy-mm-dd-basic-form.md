You can write regular [markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage. I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

```
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

## Boxes

You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

### Warning

### Error
